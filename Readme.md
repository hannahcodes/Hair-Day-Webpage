Peer 1:
nice choice of colors. i personally would like a max width of the content. not a fan of bootstrap. somewhat responsive, to commit to this the 3 cards in a row should change to a column. nicely done

Additional tips Accessibility: Consider sufficient color contrasts (light beige on white can be difficult to read). CSS semantic structure: Add more specific comments or group styles by section (e.g. /* Banner */, /* Articles */, etc.) Typography: no defined rules (font-family, line-height), it would be useful to define them globally for harmony.
