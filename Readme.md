Intro: 
I am currently enrolled in a online course series, Coursera Meta Front End Development. This project was assigned in one of the courses to apply the skills learnt for HTML and CSS so far. 

I am practicing using scripting languages HTML and CSS. I plan to move onto Javascript after gaining a better understanding of the fundamentals. The goal is to eventually become a UX Engineer, combining the principles of UX design and Front End Developing.

Peer Review Feedback:

Peer 1:
nice choice of colors. i personally would like a max width of the content. not a fan of bootstrap. somewhat responsive, to commit to this the 3 cards in a row should change to a column. nicely done

Peer 2: 
Additional tips Accessibility: Consider sufficient color contrasts (light beige on white can be difficult to read). CSS semantic structure: Add more specific comments or group styles by section (e.g. /* Banner */, /* Articles */, etc.) Typography: no defined rules (font-family, line-height), it would be useful to define them globally for harmony.
